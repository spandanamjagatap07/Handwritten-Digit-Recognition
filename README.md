# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Built a handwritten digit recognition system using machine learning  techniques and the MNIST dataset. Trained models such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Convolutional  Neural Networks (CNN) to classify digits with high accuracy. Applied image preprocessing and  feature extraction to enhance model performance.
